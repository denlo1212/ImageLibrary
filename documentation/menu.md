### global variables and functions
lets start with global variables and functions.
```javascript
// Sometimes you need to influence the page you are on; with this variable, you can change that.
int global.pageNumber

// Checking if a dialog or modal is open is important so you can disable certain keys while they are active or not.
boolean global.isDialogOpen

// Rendering the images again after changing something is very important, so it is a global function usually used with pageNumber.
function window.render()
```
